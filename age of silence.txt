What do you see when you see
    a child
            a woman
                    a man?
I see a library millenia in the making,
written by a series of artists who crafted
the most beautiful works in the Universe.


As they wrote symphonies to last as the stars fade and beckon:
As Authors spilling ink across the seas;
    as painters throwing dyes through the lands;
            as musicians weaving chords and notes among the skies;
                    as dancers spinning shadows towards the heavens...


Flames of craftmanship tearing apart,
    breaking the Earthen plates underfoot
    realeasing pain among the fractured shards of olympian
    scultpures, as it forms and reforms the image of it's desire:
it's consuming and frenzy'd wickedness to last--to be remebered,
    for no other reason but that it can,
            that it molds and shakes the eternal bars of granite/abiotic stillness
    summoning and seperating life and death, the lovers who
            wish to be together for the eons of all,
            forcing all who choose to live, to lie again in the arms
                    of darkness, asleep until the time comes,
            that these two titans may lie as one, when the galaxies spin
                    no more, it will be the time of the breathless, in an

age of silence.
