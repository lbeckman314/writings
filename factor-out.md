title: factor out

```
sometimes the fact that someone is a person is factored out
(we're all people) like a common factor

sometimes the idea that anyone is a human being is ignored
(because everyone is)

but that just leaves objects behind, things that can be used
and discarded and reused in all sorts of ways.

somehow being human can be factored out
until being a person doesn't mean anything anymore.
```
