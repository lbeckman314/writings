```
Have you seen the wonderbird
    flying through the trees above
    collecting twigs for it's nest

Have you heard the wonderbird 
    cry out from the cold
    out among the frozen night

Have you held the wonderbird
    with feathers cracked and twisted
    from the howling wind outside

It only comes out after a storm has
    broken the branches off the pines and firs
    and simply carries them away to it's nest.

Have you seen the wonderbird
    flying through the trees above
    like it did in the past
```
