walking though hospital, with three leg horse galloping in place within one room, waling down hallway, entering audiotrium, vertigo, surgurical obeservation (with doctors and nurses seated vertically around a plain opertaing table). On the table is an exquistitly folded origami in the shape and size of a person or child. The doctor is cutting through it like a real surgery.

In the far future, perhaps an advanced society or creature could take one atom from our universe and use it to recreate (in a sort of simulation) everything that had happened in that universe. In this way our present actions will be committed, forgotten for millenia, and then perhaps watched again (like a movie) by someone in the far future. Children are like this, in that they may see or hear things adults do withoyut recognizng it (like taking drugs, or being violent, sex, or anything beyound a child), and only recollect it and fully understand it later on.

Field of red worms, some become violet, pulsing while a whale-sized organ or creature is slowly disgorged from the ground by the writinging worms. A birth of sorts, that is either stillborn or soon dead. As if the worms are trying permutations to create some lifeform.

```
There is a pulsing movement, as all the worms begin to hoard and undulate together.
    The movement becomes stronger and erratic.
    Some of the writhing creatures turn from blood-red to violet.
    And from the wet earth, from among the worms, a tremendous mass is slowly disgorged.

    It is hidden from sight. It is covered in red and violet worms.
    It does not move, and the worms start to consume.

    I think they will try again, until they create something that moves.

```
Ravenous blood-red worms convulse on end in the murky field,
    as if boiled on a hotplate.
    Seizing the rolling fog that looks like steam.
    Making fleshy wet slapping noises as stomachs turn.

There's few else around, a student passing on the trail behind,
    looking in my direction; but not at the field, nor the blood-red worms.

They're gone, look back. Pick a branch, dry and hollowed. Approach and reach forward,
    forward, forward.

Spun

Conclave/cult that believes you enter a parallel world every time you spin around. Spend all day spinning to reach further and further worlds until one day they will reach nirvana. Schism appears in cult, with some believeing that clockwise spinning will lead them to the desired dimension, while others practice counter clockiwise spinning. Perhaps the opposite of Nirvana is Purgatory. The cult splits, 50-50. Spinning goes on until one day, half  of the cult is gone (counter clockwisers or clockwisers). The remaining group don't know if they themeselves have reached nirvana or purgatpry, or if the other half did. The group disassembles, with members going out into the world to investigate the world they find themeselves in, and with other members spinning opositely to try to reach the missing members. Some individuals believe that somersaulitng is instead the way (spinning forward).
