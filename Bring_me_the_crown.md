"Bring me the crown" I say to you,
    my servant
"With her head attached!"
    as you rush out.


I sit back and worry,
    that I've toppled a kingdom,
    by letting her rise
        in the land of death.

From the one alone in a forgotten land,
    to the master, commander, lord of us all.
I loved her as a brother, (as only one can) as a friend,
    this lonely, wicked, tooth'd maul.

"Bring me the crown"
