I bespeak a  tendernes to my creation
    for within it I spy myseld exemplifed to an ideal
I draw a line
                and there is my arm
    he paunts a landsace
                and so crafts his torso
        she drafts a figue
                amd brings to genesis the flow of her hair
FOr therin lies no want of a creatureso carefukl
    under burden of so preciosu an ore.

I solenmly touch upon your clthes ,and so your world into creation
    you ponder my contencem and so too do the same for I.
The falling snow, static in in its motion,
    rides the lines Farradatm sing in afugue of worldy prominance,
        evicdemce of far-flung'd arrsiosns, sirrssions, orgins.
