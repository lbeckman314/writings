# JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL

This is one of my favorite books of all time! It has to do with two English magicians in the 19th century – sorta of a mix between Jane Austen and Harry Potter (except without the romance of the former and the exciting parts of the latter, but don't worry! It's good! Really!).

# THE BOOK THIEF 

I *love* this book and hope you guys will too! It follows a young German girl during the ending of World War II, as she and her family try to make the best of what they can. Markus Zusak is a great (Australian!) author with some cool writing quirks. The ending is terribly sad. I first finished the book in a downpour at the U of O, while getting absolutely drenched – waiting to let go of these wonderful characters as their world falls headfirst around them. Upon completing this story, I got up, turned around, and threw my copy into the nearest hedge. I was a tad emotional. It's a great book, really!

# ROBERT BURNS POEMS AND SONGS

No explanation required. 

# WATER: PORTLAND'S PRECIOUS HERITAGE

I remember talking about the importance of water on the Owahee River, and how it's perhaps the *most* important resource we have. This book is just a cool little look into the local Oregonian water – including the history and politics surrounding the  whole shebang 

# COMET IN MOOMINLAND

An absolutely charming story by Finnish artist and author Tove Jansson. These cute little marshmallow-like critters called Moomins go around exploring things and having fun, until a space comet threatens to hit the Earth and destroy everyone and everything. The whole Moomin series is very popular among little Swedish kids growing up. They have a funny sense of things.

# DOWNWARD BOUND

Hilarious book detailing the first climb of *the Wall of the Early Morning Light* by one of the climbers himself – Warren Harding. Harding is either one of the best climbers in the world, or a drunken rock barnacle, depending on who you ask. Regardless, he's really funny and an absolute blast to read. *Semper Farcisimus!* 

# ESTERHAZY

A rabbit prince and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Need I say more?

# HIS DARK MATERIALS

Awesome trilogy including *Northern Lights*, *The Subtle Knife*, and *The Amber Spyglass*. These three stories are mostly set in an alternate world, where part people's souls exist as animal companions of sorts, called daemons. A young girl Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon go on adventures involving the clashing of polar bears and god and scientists and aliens. It's a wild ride, but also a really fun one!

# WHAT IS LIFE

*Baby don't hurt me! Don't hurt me, no more!*

I hope you enjoy this nifty little (proto-) genetics book!


# CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY MADE RIDICULOUSY SIMPLE

This book is for all of your microbio teaching needs! 


# SYLVIA PLATH DRAWINGS   

This is a small collection of Plath's drawings and illustrations, presenting a side to her that I did not know very much about. While a prolific writer and poet, she was also a very talented artist. I really like her sketches, and I hope you will too!


# THE COLLECTED POEMS OF SYLVIA PLATH

And on the more well known side, here is a collection of her poems!
