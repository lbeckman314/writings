Hej hej Carl!

I'm really glad to hear from you! I am indeed back at the UO for my last term before graduation and I would love to meet up again for lunch or coffee. My Tuesdays, Thurdays, and Fridays are espcially open, but would be able to meet other days as well. Do you have a particular time that works for you? 

I quickly wanted to give my deepest thanks for all your help way back in Spring of 2015--without you I wouldn't have been able to study biology in Uppsala.

Mountains of Thanks,
liam
