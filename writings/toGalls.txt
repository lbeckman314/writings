Hello!

I made it down all right and moved in without any problems. I dropped off the cooler with Forrest on Saturday! He was awfully nice and invited me to a star trek theatre showing ("The Game"). Anyways, I hope you two are having a good start to your week, and I hope Rachel and Henry are enjoying their time in Europe!

Mountains of Thanks,
Liam
