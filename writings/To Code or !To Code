To Code or !To Code

I loved reading what opinions people had on this subject! Regardless of whether one ought to code or not, I second Bobby's stance that anyone can learn cold. So much of my respect for programming in general is that it remains so open and inclusive to anyone from any background. Many if not most of the tools a programmer requires are free (as in free beer and free as in freedom!) and tutorials abound for many of the concepts and principles of programming. So if one were curious at all about coding, all they need is a computer, an internet connection, and a desire to give it a shot. Like the thing with feathers in Emily Dickinson's beautiful poem*, coding will provide a world of opportunity and "Yet - never - in Extremity, / It asked a crumb - of me."

In terms of being required to learn or not, part of me agreed with Abala and Bobby in that while certainly useful to certain professions, programming need not necessarily be a required subject for everyone. Especially when knowledge of programming would not be a clear advantage to one's future. Instead, perhaps it should be made available to anyone curious about coding, but not strictly enforced in the way that reading and writing are.
.

But, I also agreed with Tim and Heriberto’s perspective that programming languages can be as useful (or more so!) than learning foreign languages (which are commonly required). Both Tim and Heriberto brought up the analytical and logic-based benefits to learning how to code and, interestingly, both brought up how well integrated early programming and Minecraft work together for younger students. That popular applications like Minecraft and efforts like Hour of Code work so well together makes me very optimistic about the future of programming in general.

Linus Torvalds, the original creator of the Linux kernel, shared an interesting perspective on the value of coding in a 2014 interview**. In it, he discussed the idea originating “from Silicon Valley that everyone’s ‘gotta learn to code,’”. With this perspective in mind, he addressed what he would change, if anything, about today's computer science education:
.
I actually don't believe that everybody should necessarily try to learn to code. I think it's reasonably specialized, and nobody really expects most people to have to do it. It's not like knowing how to read and write and do basic math.
.
That said, I think people should have some way of getting exposure to it, just so that people who find that they enjoy it and have the aptitude know about the possibility. Not because everybody will want to or need to learn, but just because it is a great vocation, and there may well be lots of people who never realized that they might actually like telling computers what to do. So in that sense I think computer courses in schools are a great idea, even if I do not believe in the "everybody should learn to code" thing.
.
.
As a side note, I share many Tim’s views regarding the slightly limited utility of Latin, and indeed, other languages when compared to a more career-focused subject such as coding. That two years of foreign language are required for admission to most of Oregon’s four-year universities**, while many high schools continue to lack a dedicated programming curriculum belies a bit of a disconnect between high school administrators and the student body. However, it must be said that those two years of language include far more than semantics, syntax, and grammar. When one learns another (human) language, they get a familiarization with the culture and history of an entire human background. This cross-cultural element remains an invaluable part of most foreign language curriculum. Programming languages, on the other hand, do not have this established human element. But they do, as Tim addresses, have more value in the analytical and career realm. As computers become more and more integrated into our daily lives, it will be up to us how to balance these two very different types of language studies.

Thank you all for a wonderful course and superb discussions!
