ask a stone if it is worried about anything and the
	stone will respond "not particularly".
	and yet that's not the stone responding,
		that's you giving the stone a voice it does not have
			the stone doesn't care
			if not only doesn't even care,
				it can't ever even not care.

The stone is a stone, and that's all it will ever be
	until it is subsumed into the earth again
		and turned into more rock or dust or magma.

From there, some atoms of that original stone
	may again be ejected onto the surface as another stone.

Some may have even reached their ends,
	and split into smaller things yet unknown.

And yet one or two atoms may be incorporated into the growing roots of
	a microbe, or a even a plant. What a thing!

But what if that atom is instead made into a living, /feeling/ creature,
	a bug, or...a mouse,
		a bug or mouse that moves away from pain.
			and if that bug or mouse is unlucky, and falls into pain, then
			that poor stone will then feel things a stone should never have to feel.
