1   I like to number my lines
2       to keep track of where I am
3   for if I did not,
4       I would surely be a sham!

.---------------------------------------.
|   I like to keep my writing contained |
|       in simple boxes for me to see   |
|   for if I did not,                   |
|       they might overthrow me         |

Sometimes my letters are dɒɔʞwɒɿbƨ
    sometimes ∩bƨ!qө-qoʍu
and whenever I try to ask them something
    they never seem to be 
        a  r   o       u       n           d......!

Once in a while, I feel like a king
    when    my      words   remain  orderly
    serving me      in      my      tasks
    doing   what    I       ask     in
    a       manner  so      very    lov'e'ly!

But other times a jester am I,
                  ences    
          sent             in
      
     ling                      the 

   jugg                           air
........................................
 hoping                           care

      they                      a
          
          land             out
                  with

So whether by choice or whether by chance
    whether by (I) sway or whether by (I) dance
        either a ruler or fool I may be 
            whichever it is, it is ('tis) fine with me!
