Lest you lettis parch and dry
    and fall to deathly decay
Spil thy dark'd rosie'd drinlk
    and there let it stay
In the revered company of blossoms and lovers too
    consumed with life to let it sink
    stands your resovoird hues
    of earyl morning cobweb pink

So crack a flahs and open your drought
    and toast against this earthly rot
    to let the suders have ther due
        in whatever divine you so choose

For it's lovely, so simply clear
    and too good to allow you to harbor fear
    so do so, doso, do so and so die
        in the dawn of every sun to come.
        in the dusk of every star to die.

"C'est la vie"
