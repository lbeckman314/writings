```
What does it sound like to you
    when you brush your hair
        behind your ear?
The forgiving wind on warm leaves?
The whisper of whiskers wishing only
to please?
The sigh of linen bearing the fullness
    of a body?
What does it sound like?


Let it remain a world of grains, sand and wheat
and all things pleasant and lasting
    falling across, curving beyond an eclipse


For one of the things you are to me —
    a heart of eden
        an amber radiance
            a forgotten world.


“Shy Behaviors”
