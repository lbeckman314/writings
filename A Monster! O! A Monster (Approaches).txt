When the words will not appear,
type out the letters ,and let them form themselves,
into the shapes they want, the shapes that ellude you
and bind you in the dark

Without a friend in the world,
ask for ink and paper, and all will be good,
for who are you but one dazzled by lights and music that you
couldn't (see &) hear (deep) in the dark.

And while you attend the dances, 
pray put in a kind word for me, and ask the master
to forgive my tresspasses on his grounds, for you see.
I was cold out in the dark.

"A Monster! O! A Monster (Approaches)!"
