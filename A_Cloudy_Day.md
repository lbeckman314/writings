Goodnatured Day adress'd in robes of grey
    prepr's to partake in the formalest of regal occasions
        might I suggest a touch of blue to mathch your hidden eyes?
        wondrous & cool
                (cool & clean, strong & sure)
            like a queen's stance at wartime
                prep'd to accept the surrender.

A toast! For your daytime knivings & quip pro quos
    enliven the atmosphere with your devil-maypcare green
        steal the hearts and cursh the suitors
            to until wherever the wind may throw us together aign,
                Adieu!

"A Cloudy Day"
