Do we see eachother
        anymore?

Or are we peices of furniture ro be
        moved around the room to
                give it a new lok?
(or) plants to water and maintain
        with dead leaves to excise and remove

Are we things to repair with our
        time waste son we dont know what.
                rending and wrecking
                regretting and resenting

                                the two people
who share our names, and seem lost in al the world.

Can we play together again or are we changed
        forever my freiend
Can I hold you in my arms
        abd forgive wat you've done
        and forget what I've become
then still love you like I;ve always wated to do?
