```
The brink isn't the chasm,
Its the last piece of land before falling in,
and the first handhold after climbing out.
It's the edge of an edge of an edge.

Who are the most free? It asks above.
Who are the most free? It asks below.
Those with me, it replies.
Existing so happily, Merrily so.

It doesn't take anything to be on one side of it.
But it takes everything to be on the other.
```
