```
Look! Look! There goes the man, the golden man,
  the man so good at everything,
See how he walks and the world moves,
  hear him sigh and the world cry
          The man!
            The man!
He goes to work as the greatest,
  the greatest at what, you ask?
Why, at everything boy!
  Aye, there he goes, away from us,
into the (the pride of our children. END) sacred marrow,
wearing the pride of our children.

"Wow!"
```
