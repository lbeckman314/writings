```
I've spent all my time afraid.
    worried and shivvering.
Don't look, here they come:
    two women in floral prim dresses
        come to give me my diploma before i've finished
            the courses.
they hand it to me. i've yet to finish, I tell them.
    they look so disgusted, and take it back.

Leave and two men in dark suits appear,
    come to take me away, humiliate
        commiting great crimes
            requires great restitution.
    Stand in front of your victims, apologize
        I'm so sorry, repressing acidic bile shaking.

Loved left down
    Let down loved
    once I cleaved the innocent and long-suffering.
    dashed in part in dream
        so long-felt and held close
            to bare chests.
