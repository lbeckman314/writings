```
You hear something following you â€•
long, ashen, rain-soaked hair

what do you want dog?
here it comes, tounge lulling,
as if it knew you it's entire life
and found you hiding behind a tree.

it curls up and presses at your feet,
sniffing for morsels
guarding you from anything bad.
good dog.
```
