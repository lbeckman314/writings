In the meantime I wrote of
        world unbroken

and I played with my sight
            to create a kaleidoscopic
microcosm for mt own - where everyday I saw my love and
            we wanted nohting else
                    but our desires and our time

He believed she would breathe as
        a saviour       extant and nascent
        a lover         entreating and warm
        a friend        comfort and home

I allied and sought for a homeland
        In my words unbroken
                And I found you
                    In horizons
                    escaping.

"Glass Halos (Splintered)"


The man explored the trash bin for something to read. The words from earlier remained, but dying--soon to fade. Conscious of his behaviour,  he searched around for any worrying glances from strangers. Finding a welcome isolatoipon, he dug deeper. Past the leftover neakm anud rge reciepts and all the paper dirtied by teh world, but not by ink. Violently thrashing his face upwards--coughing bloodin into the air. The man stood calm and watchful, slowly looking downwards again and peering farther and further into where the dark made a home.Nothing worth spending time for. Rub hands o the brick wall to teh right. Confirm n'ones watching. The misting eain and teh halogen street lamps made haloes togethere fo rteh man the admire and make words for.

Late was his condition. Freezong was not. HIs exposed neck and jaw bled a humble steam into the air, attemotuib ti eeet the haloes above. If they ever did, the man did nti see, HE broke feelings unto the world in front of hukm. A grace typically foreign t the 2 am neighbirhood. Blackness and aonymoys--veins and pains-- amid and all through the night. If you stood on the road as he passes, you would wonder whethere he atracted the color od opened bread or opened flesh--coth followed at an intmate distance.

A Blackened Leaf

Ash slowly falling from a cigarette, smoke rising in serpentine forms. Outside, a flickering streetlight catching the rain in it's halo. With the light off momentarily, the darkness encroached – filling the street below and buildings above with a sickened tar. "Christ, I'm tired," growled the detective as he looked out the window. His office occupied the 5th floor of the block, and on nights like this he wished it was just slightly higher up – five stories would hurt, but wouldn’t gurantee a clean death. The detective lazily eyed the nails in the windowsill, hammered there himself, what was it? Three years ago? Five? It didn't matter. Time had done it's damage, had burst open his door and demanded payment. It had got it. The detective was worn out and old. Too damn old to stay in this business. Time was no longer his concern. What he cared about took the form of cold metal. Specifically metal that flew at and around him whenever he got on the wrong side of something. Whether that be the drug cartels, the accountants, or the law itself didn't matter. All of them resulted in the same thing. He glanced over at his door, and at the bonsai tree tucked away in the corner. Where the hell had that come from? He wondered. Whether a gift from a (grateful) gratiated client, or an adoption from a raid, he could not remember. The tree itself was healthy enough, though a bit weathered and unkempt. It didn’t seem to mind sharing an office with the detective, and he was glad enough that it stayed to itself and didn’t cause trouble.

A deep, slow purr wound it's way from the radiator, a purr that the detective was always happy to hear. He leaned over and patted the orange and black tabby warming itself by the desk. It had been a good companion for several years now, staying out of the way when things got rough, and staying close by when things were quiet. It's quiet now by god, thought the detective, let it stay this way just a while longer. He began to doze off, listening to the tip – tap – tip of the rain outside, imagining a world where all that existed was the warm purring of a cat... The window exploded inwards, sending a richocheting cascade of glass and noise everywhere. The walls on his left and right gave way to bullet fragments flying in and out and all through and off. The door remained shut, until exploding in flames and debris, splintering and throwing each handpainted letter of D E T E C T I V E to seperate sides of the now demolished office. Throughout all the destruction and reverberations, (throughout it all,) the bonsai tree remained standing.

He didn’t think, he didn’t question. All he did was throw himself to the ground, over the cat, while all around him grew cataclysmic shuddering, tearing at his exposed arms and legs, throwing his insides inside out. The shifting beneath him, whether feline or floorboards moving around, did not help his predicament. Eyes closed shut beneath flashes of light, he could feel a singing heat by his left hand, the south side wall was on fire, and was catching his jacket sleeve, burning his wrist. The detective moved away, towards the desk, towards the only thing still standing. And suddenly it was over. He sat up and saw for a moment thousands of pages, from files, from books, shredded and flying all around him. Some ending up near the open flames, spreading it to more than a third of the room. And what else? Four walls all but torn down, no glass left unbroken, and the cat? He looked down for the body of his companion, finding it absent.
Where had that godamned thing went? Where is it? God... -- What in all the hells is --
The detective stopped looking for the cat, for what he saw moving outside on the street, five stories below, sent a chill up his spine.
What is that?



"The beginning of the universe was an ending of all thing previous -- a death of all the worlds that were, all the beings that sang, and everything everywhere ceased to be for this universe to come into existance. At the time of creation, you could see all that would be. Every rise and fall, every breath of all things great and inconsequential. And if you looked behind, you would see all that ever was, all you had ever known. Past glories of conquest made black, romances that cut deep and red, children born of races and societies never again to be realized. It is painful to think of all that, of everything held dear, every thing you ever cared about, reduced to a nothingness so vast, that nothing could fill it. Nothing but a entirelly new constellation of worlds and galaxies, strewn across and over eachother, with no resemblance to anything that was. That's how it is."

“Huh.” replied he detective. He was deeply moved.

A strange silence grew between the two. Both had said what was needed to be said, in their own way.
