```
Pretend I'm someone else when I jump out,
dressed in a sheet
10 steps forward, through the door, around the corner
BOO
Down the stairs, through the door. 
everything's fine again

Act like you don't know me when you see me,
painted all over, red and white
Up the stairs, around the room, by the window
AAH
through the kitchen, in the pathway
no danger anymore

I'll be someone else in there, with fangs and fur
Over the landing, into the basement, from the corner
ROAR
suffling against the wall, past the light
safe and sound

You've never seen me like this, understand,
with a mask and bloody knives
10 steps forward, from the top floor, down the stairs,
everything's fine again, as it always was.
```
