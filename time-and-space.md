Tell me about the times
    when we would stay up late to watch
        the stars
    and we’d feel special for having found eachother
        when the lights above were so separate
        and the air so cold and distant
    Yet here we lay, in eachother’s tiredness and embrace
        making time for one another
            because we enjoyed our company
                above all else.
Tell me about the places
    we would go
        visiting towns and lights entirely foreign
        just to feel the sameness we’d grown
            the familiar, the lasting and unchanging.
And when we grew old and tired, that’s what
    you remained to me--though all the fears and nights
        and troubles and stars
    strewn over the changing skies


You were my home
You were my lasting.


“Time and Space”
