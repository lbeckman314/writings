Notes on Altered Chronologies.


We recieved the instructions at 10:01 am on October 01, 1999. They were detailed, and gave us everything we needed to construct the transmitter. Many of us, including myself, were rightly apprehensive. Pranks and conspiracies were at times common among certain groups within the radio community. We were not a large team, but we were aqequately funded for our purposes (primarily radio engineering used in satellite communications). The instructions were dismissed by most who read it, including me. Yet some members of the research team kept it around out of novelty, trading notes and ideas among themselves. They were most excited about The Proof of Concept, a section of the instructions detailing trading information in a dozen markets. Information that proved to be exact in both quantity and and in time.


Engineering the transmitter was costly, but not prohibitively so. Expenses were precisely covered by short-term speculative investments. Member A headed this effort, and quickly became the de-facto treasurer of the group. The transmitter itself was not large, and could be worked on without drawing attention from nearby offices. I am not sure what prompted us to remain secretive with it. But an unspoken rule of the project was that such an effort would be best served in relative anonymity, as least in the relative future. After we had successfully completed our first transmission and retrieval, we would submit our findings to an appropriate governing body.


It took us 6 months and 6 days to finish. 9 days later, at 10:01 am, we sent our first transmission. We included in our message only what we were told to include.

We debated the effects we were having on those timelines. Whether we could rightfully collapse entire chronologies. And knowing that your timeline could be replaced at any "moment" naturally led oneself to depressive ideations. We termed the "moment" that a timeline ended as "chronological decay". Yet that depended on whether there was a "future" or if this moment in time represented the spearhead of time. The latter was more comforting, as it meant we were not destroying anything, but only changing the direction of our own branch in time.

Through our efforts, we compiled a short list of rules/laws.

I. Timelines cannot merge together.
II. The collapse of a time line is always coupled with the rise of another time line. (By I. and II. there are only two known timelines: worldA and worldB).
III. worldA and worldB travel in parallel in opposite directions. Our future is their past and vice versa.
IV. We have a window of approximately 50 years in which we could expect mutual communications. Attempting to introduce the machine before 1950WB would not be technologically feasible.
V. Recieving a transmission results in the decay of your original future and the rise of an altered future.
VI. Due to stochastic effects, starting a block by transmitting information results in the decay of your timeline. The exact moment in time would have to be reached in order for this to be false.
VII. A Block is an exchange of information between two timelines (or mathematically speaking, any number of timelines). Blocks can be Closed, in which case information is sent by altered timeline. Due to stochastic effects involved in the transmisison, Blocks will always be Crooked, whereby the sending and reciving of transmissions will never be executed at the moments they originally were. Finally, blocks can be open, in which case information is not sent by the timeline that originally sent information, This leads to the original (untouced) chronology of that timeline being restored/reset.
