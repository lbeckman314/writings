Why do I rember you
and the evenings we shared
in so many years of happness?


Along the coastlines rushed the clouds
that we escaped, and the
simple rain we enjoyed
for those few weeks we had to eachother.
The rocks in the ocean grew collasol
over our heads, smoothed and shimmering (sheer)
How then did we last for as long as
we did, when so much forced us apart
again and again.


Why then do I remember you,
the face that you stole from my hands, my marble?
The nape I desired in such a fashion as to fit you exactly.
Tell me of the movemnets you danced
along the surf, wirh you and the mist as
partners, and footprints as the only record
of our Love, You were dressed, I recall, in
a dress of cotton, so close in
shade to the colness ofthe sea
with the feel of you so close to my skin.


How then did we end, you and I?
FOr we were all the same, you and I.
As an echo of one another reverberates and
magnifis the sweat and dust/sweat dust surrounding us
on our pale, light, sweet blue Earth.
