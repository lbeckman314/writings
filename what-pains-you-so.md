Hallo, hallo there, What pains you so? Why cry you kind sir?

I — I'm afraid I just don't have it anymore.

Have what you silly man?

It! I'm not /good/ anymore, if I ever was?
Look at my hands — see how they shake. What can I do with these.
And look at my mind — scrambled, weary, and worn-out. I'm tired sir. I'm so tired.

HA! I've had the keen pleasure of seeing far less that /you/ make greater things than you could ever dream of. Palaces for long-lived and long-last kingdoms, symphonies that shook planets with choruses that fell like snow and rose like lightning. Equations that tore this universe apart and stitched ten more together, sculptures of living stars that breathed life into dead galaxies. All of these created by creatures both big and small — some larger than time itself, and still others smaller than an idea. And yet to me you look no different any being Ive seen before — for you are simply art and math made manifest, making are and math in every stroke of a pen — so strike! Strike and be young, immortal old — anything you wish! Create, dance, laugh, cry, despair, live in each of your strikes! Strike and make me a world to live & die in, and quite likely, in of those worlds, I will meet a creature that tells me they are old, too tires, too stricken with sadness to do much at all. And so I will stop, listen, and ask "what pains you so?"
