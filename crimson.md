I've wondered if that's the cause of all thisâ€”
    if we've broken some terrible law,
        some order of the world that most people
    would never think of crossing.

Our skin will be dyed splotched crimson and violet,
    for as long as it stay's tied to us.

And we will die in a world we do not understand,
    frightened and alone.
