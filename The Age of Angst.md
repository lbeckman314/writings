You tell me it's time to go, and I couldn't agree more.
For you see,


I was young once, wasn't i?
I was beautiful and naive and free to
    roam this world, untethered and unfearing,
With those lovers that stole my kisses.
    Will they remember me still, after all this time?
    Would they recognize my face? My heart that
            lusted and comforted in equal measure.


I remember them all, as I remember yesterday slip away from my grasp
    as I cry for it to stay, because I
            cannot live without my yesterdays
    for I have no tomorrows left. I am old. I am older still.


And all those moments of a life, so little and O! so perfect,
    that collected on my windowsill
    for me to gaze at and remember,
portraits of a life lived and a time shared.
   They will leave me too, and so I say (to you)(,):
How I leave now,
                   is not for you to decide,
                    but for me to tell:


I leave with a world of woe behind me and the stars of sorrow ahead.
