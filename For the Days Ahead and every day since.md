```
For the Days Ahead...




Listening to my boy play
like the sons of our past, our yesterdays that last


As we conquer’d and lost
As we broke and fought
among foreign lands  and crimson sands


Having you by my side in those stranger times
when we marched and charg’d and sang our call
into the wind-stripp’d night for the death of all.


We were never meant to see the end of those days


And still we stayed.
In the forests and in the fires we reigned.


Yet without you, where would I be
frozen among the mud, under the stars supreme
crying for home lost
for the lights were gone, and I could not see my way.


But you were there to see us through
you kept us warm and steadied our blood


Under the exploding sky I took shelter by you.


And there I will stay,
for all (the) seasons to march us by.
With you I will stay.


Watch us, brother:
Young and breathless, laughing at the falling sun
and calling for the girls we will meet when we find our way back home.




...and Every Day Since
