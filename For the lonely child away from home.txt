I play the anthem of a world
    ceased to be.
Alone and proud this melody wanes
    from a time forgotten
        for a people extinct.

Look up on a clear night and
    spy the light that lies, that wished,
        as I do,
            for a a home lasting and searene
        but knows the song is dawing to a close
        very nearly, and so dearly, done.

And yet we survive to share our memories,
    as a minstrel for the missing
    and as an artist for the artefacts.

I play I play I play
        I want them to know
        I play and I would forget 
    the world stood in a brightess that finds
the edges of all
    and falls aay in the song I play
and the ligt reminds me, as I remind it,
    of a promise to keep 
        adn a time to weep
for my friends and family in a mempory
    that cripplees and tears us apart,
        because we are much too far away
            because we loved
                and were loved
        in the way that breaks
    and in the way that nurtues
        because we were our chilren,
            and our children's children
                and so the anthem goes.

"For the lonely child away from home
    and for the light of yesterday to
        bring the world another night"
