I remember you playing at the beach
    when you were five years old
looking for pebbles & shells
        left behind by the waves
The wind made funny shapes with your hair
    and carried you along the shore
as the ocean glistened around you
    excited at meeting you for the very first time.

"pebbles & shells"
