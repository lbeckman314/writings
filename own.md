I'm not necessarily afraid of 
    freezing in the night,
    or getting into a fight
    or even losing my sight.

I am afraid of what my mind will do
    what it will conjure and show to me.
    what chemicals it will and will not release
    for me, despite my resistance.

We're all bound by our genetic code,
    forced to do what it wants us to do.
    forced to duplicate it
    forced to ensure it's existance.

That's not always a bad thing, 
    there's a lot of good within that bound
    there's a universe of good within our means.

but we are bound. 
And sometimes it's very frightening.
