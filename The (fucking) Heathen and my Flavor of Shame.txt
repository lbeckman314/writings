Hello Heathen,
    no, I don't want to talk to you
    then why'd I say hello?
    That's the civilized thing to do.
    But I wouldn;t expect you to know that.

    Do I want to join you (for Dinner)?
    Regretfully--no.I do not have the whetted apetite for 
    your endlessly decadent tastes nor you prolonged company, you maelstrom of
    rogue orgy and starlit vice.
You oil your skin with sin and tan under the kiss of lovers
    (levae me to do my taxes)
