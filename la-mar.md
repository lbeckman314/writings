Meeting grandfather (patriarch) before traveling away, getting words of wisdom (first meeting or first in a while, since birth or induction?)

Hearing themes or stories about what all goes on, patriarch is old and wizended, maybe a tad remorseful but hopeful, sharing too many details about secret things 

Traveling on the ship, explosion or sabatage (attempted assassination), how does he escape or inadvertantly avoid this? Give agency so he's not just walking into things but also have every coincidence be a challenge.

Returning home and seeing everything destroyed and on fire, patriarch + family missing?, La Mer

La Mar

I.

Outside with the sound of the waves, a ryhthmic plunk-plunk-plunk against the side of the boat, the waxing moon reflecting and giving shape to the waves. He looked over the side and saw the helm cut through the reflections. How long was this going to take — a week? A month? Reaching for the ledger and finding his name on the last line, below that of his father and mother. How did they feel when they were where he was? He held his fingers up to their signatures, tracing them.

plunk-plunk-plunk

A scream from somewhere in the cabins — he closed the ledger and ran inside. A member of his escort team ran up from the lower levels, his eyes wide.

"Wait!" And then lights go out flooding the stairwell with darkness.

Arms out feeling for another person, something to hold. They grasp eachother and move together — heat from the other side of the door and light from a blaze — a locked door and more screams from below.

"Come here boy, don't be afraid — is everything in order? You'll have access to everything you need once you arrive, remember your lessons and don't be fool hardy. Have I told you about my first voyage? I'm sure I have, that was back when they only gave you a copy of the ledger and some cheap ink to write your history in. Now, hah! You have more than all my fathers put together, they were the ones that gave me everything I'm giving you. I hope you'll learn just how valuable this is for you and for your future children and grandchildren."

The voice echoed around the palace room.

"Th-thank you sir", he replied 

"Innunciate! Speak clearly and innunciate my boy, with conviction! Remember, the most important thing, the struggle and the challenges. You must remember this, my father would tell me, that the most important thing is our challenge. Strive, young man, and we will see brighter shores..."

Trailing off, heavy doors closing, being escorted to the docks and setting sail...

The ship sunk quietly, slow and then out at once. They shared their lifecraft with the remaining group from the palace and the ships crew.

"What happened, were they able to escape, they were saying the fire started in the engine room, did you see it?"

"Were you able to broadcast our location?"

"No of course not nothing was working at the end!"

"How far away are we", he asked

"We're only 50 miles away", a crew member replied. "As soon as we send out a signal we'll have a rescue crew here in 10 minutes."

"Don't", he replied, keep the broadcasting silent. "Do-Don't let anyone know where we are. How long would it take to row back?"

The waves brushed against the craft, the same plunk-plunk-plunk sound, the moon set below the horizon, and without any light the stars glinted across black sea.

A mother with a baby in her arms, singing a lullaby

  Oh my love
  we were younger when we met
  we were younger when you left
  far away to distant shores
  but I still love you forevermore

  Oh my love
  I have wasted all my days
  on thoughts of you, your loving gaze
  though you be so far
  I'll sail the sea, I'll sail la mar

  They call it the sea
  We call it la mar

"She's so young, Zyra, in her own way. How does she enjoy the texts?"

The boy knew exactly what to say in return, how to say it to please the grandfather.

"She's very good at it — she's even better than I am."

"Oh! That's good! That's good... And you work hard, that's all that matters, everything else will come from that. Everything will come together in ways you can't imagine yet..."

Another silence. The grandfather's richer voice returned.

"You know... you're reaching beyond me. I've known it for quite some time, I can't tell you how proud that makes me. I've done all I can, I've done what is right to do. I pray that you will feel this one day."

"Thank you, grandfather."
