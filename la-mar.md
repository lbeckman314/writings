"Have I told you our story boy? How our family came to be _the_ family?"

"No grandfather, tell me the story."

"When I was your your age, my father came to me a nd I knew what he was going to say--and I was so _excited_. I had studied as hard as I could everyday, reading and rereading the texts. Every night I would pray to read faster, to learn mire, because even then I knew I would have children of my own one day, and they would have their own children.  I wanted you to know that everything I did, I did for you and Zyra..."

Grandfather stopped for a moment, a milky look in his eyes. Slowly, his voice deeper, he resumed his thought.

"She's so young, Zyra, in her own way. How does she enjoy the texts?"

The boy knew exactly what to say in return, how to say it to please the grandfather.

"She's very good at it â€” she's even better than I am."

"Oh! That's good! That's good... And you work hard, that's all that matters, everything else will come from that. Everything will come together in ways you can't imagine yet. Every cell in your body knows what to do, all you need to do is want it to happen with every ounce of strength you've got."

Another silence. The grandfather's richer voice returned.

"You know... you're reaching beyond me Cri. I've known it for quite some time, I can't tell you how proud that makes me. I've done all I can, I've done what is right to do. I pray that you will feel this one day."

"Thank you, grandfather."

The boy held a bounded book, an old one. He had been entrusted to retrieve it by a major aunt from a minor branch of the family. She was one of those people who did not trust the official archives in matters of dispute. Such people must always check the historic records before conceding their challenge of the lineage. In some places, the boy's aunt would be threatened with excission. But here, among family members, it was something to be tolerated for the sake of peace. By providing her the information in the book, such a quarrel would soon die down.

Among the elite, questions of veracity were common forms of jostling. The questions became more serious if they involved cases of lost or stolen bodies that could not be exhumed and tested. Or in rare cases, of tampered records by ... whom? The boy had heard of shadowy factions sent by rival families changing the state records to sow distrubances among their enemies. If the head of one family had the genetic print of a common family, what did that mean for the future of his descendants? Fueled by such questions, and turned upon by various major family memebers, the head could be struck down, and their children and grandchildren removed to be replaced by those with secure records. Rumors of night-time slaughters of such families circled among the boy's classmates.


Oh my love
we were younger when we met
we were younger when you left
far away to distant shores
but I still love you forevermore

Oh my love
I have wasted all my days
on thoughts of you, your loving gaze
Though you be so far
I'll sail the sea, I'll sail la mar

They call it the sea
We call it la mar

A world that where Lamarkian evolution occurs. So characterstics are passed down based based on much they are "used" or not during one's life. So if one finds themselves a member of a family that specializes in mathematic computation, they are expected to spend their lives in that same field, so that they may "further" the level of skill that the family posesses. In this way, families value themsleves on how many generations they have been in a given field, and look to marry their children off to the families engaged in similar matters. The inevitable ffects of inbreeding among the elite families are countered with genetic manipulation, though at a higher and higher price as they continue to build their lineages.

"Common" families are called such because they may have only 1 or 2 generations of history, whereas the elite go back hundreds of generations.

The elite have access to genetic manipulation (like crispr) to enhance the effects of lamarkian evolution in their children. In this world, it has been detemrined that the effects of lamarkian evolution degrade after 2 children. The elites, wanting to create as large a family as possible while mainting the lamarkain charetristics, by and large have 2 children.

The changes that occur from generation to generation are rather pronounced, so families that specialize in labor are larger and more muscular after every generation.

This isn't so much a story of inter-generational careers (or family businesses), as it is about inter-family violence, and the freedom the elites have to design their next generations through genetic means. Cri is a young boy in an elite family who finds himself sequestered in this myopic way of life. He visits the sea (La Mar) and imagines leaving everything to follow some vague desire. Perhaps later in the story he does actually (impusively) travel accross the sea. Maybe while traveling over/on the sea, or even after he arrives somewhere (he probably doesn't find what he is looking for there), he returns and finds his family (including his siter zyra) gone. They are a victim of a rival family (hundreds of generations toppled/lost overnight), and Cri does not know if they are held prisoner (at a Laogai type prison), held for ransom, or dead. zyra may be an Anastasia like figure where she is rumored to be alive. Cri expects that he will soon be targeted, and goes back to the sea bank to wait for ... something. Maybe he goes out to look for zyra.

Elite families may have some sort of genetic data backup, where in the case of death they may be "resurrected" by having a surogate carry to term a child from that genetic pool. But in Cri's case, the facility/compund holding his family's data backup has been destroyed.

The common families are left to their own devices in regards to making living wages, health care.

The chinese social credit is analgous to some of the themes here.
