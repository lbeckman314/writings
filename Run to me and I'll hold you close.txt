Run to me and I'll hold you close
ye wicked soul of malice
Tho your heart be
iced,
    sliced, &
        calloused, from thee I'll never part
    until days be dark
and nights be light, shall I harken unto thee
    as thy turpid (turbid),
        turged, (flight) growth

"Run to me and I'll hold you close"
