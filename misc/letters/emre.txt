I hope this reaches you OK all the way in Turkey. Finals are well over here at the University of Oregon, and summer is well under way. People here in Oregon loved the total eclipse we had last month.

"The Duck", as he is known, is the official mascot of the University of Oregon, and was originally a derivative of Walt Disney's Donald Duck. Legend has it that the UO president at the time made a a handshake deal with DIsney to use Donald Duck's likeness, and thus "The Duck" was born. He was originally known as "Puddles" for most of the university's history, but recently changed his name to "The Duck" because apparently puddles was not very intimidating when it came to sports events.

Our rivals are Oregon State University, whose mascot is the Beaver. 

Oregon is a pretty democratic state, and we enjoy hearing about the shenanigans that Trump is getting up to, because it usually provides a good conversation starter with friends and family. As I write this, Trump has reaced a deal with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to provide financial assistance to Texans affected by Hurricane Harvey (along with increasing the debt ceiling and preventing a government shutdown). Hurricane Irma is bearing down on Florida after already hitting Barbuda and the US Virgin Islands. Hopefully people will make it out ok.

I hope Erdogan lets this parcel into Turkey alright. :)

your friend,
