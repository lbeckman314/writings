hun, you don't look right
talk right
feel right

fun love that good night
sleep tight
don't bite

son, keep that run don't fight
sleep outta sight no fright

cause no gun won no good light
in the old white knight zeitgeist

Aint no tight might in that top flight
No kid kite stuck in hot height

Hold back that one line in that free time
and hold your sweet mind in hun's whine.
