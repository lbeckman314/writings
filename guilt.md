I've tried ot wink and wink at you, to get my feelings understood
I've tried to convince you to feel the same for me, O! if only I could!
But since the effort has been spent to absolutely no avail
I will try my luck elsewhere, and most likely probably fail.


We wished not to find ourselves in the nightmare
	of our creation,
		so we hid among our victims,
			with hope that we would be lost forever,
				invisible to our pursuers
				invisible from the fate we knew
					we had drawn (carved) for ourselves.
"We shall suffer!" I thought
	"for all we have wrought on this land, this people."
You wished it were not true, O! if it could be espunged,
	would we not do anything. Our future pain granted by
		our past doings,
		God! Kill me where I stood, not long before.
		Strike me down and cast me off to the black
			clash of the eternal seas,
		for such an end would grant me what I have lost:
		to die a premature death as one without stain,
			who can look down upon that?
		but to face perjury as one such as I,
			who can but wish my pain a thousandfold?
Aye, you and I, my dear brother. We will end,
	and so shall this sordid chapter,
		let it, and us!, fall from the tome
			and so burn in an ashen heap of our design.

"Guilt"
