```
I never knew what to say to you,
  but I hope that one day you find my words
    in a lover's smile, or a spring's sunset.

Viscous lie, don't tell me why
  you ask why i look the way i do.
    I'm dark and terrible--i'm a monster
    in monstrous form. Like a worm crossed
      with a mean-looking spider.
Don't look at me, or you'll go mad, mad in mind
  and mad in body and you won;t muind that
    your body won't move anymore.
```
