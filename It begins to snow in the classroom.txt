It begins to snow in the classroom
and I turn to go


Passing students taking no notice
        of the
crystalline webs
        falling
                from
                        the
                                sky.


Outside, the tall pines blossom like flowers
        from the icy foundations below


On my command, the winds race and curve/curl above
        as a warmth slithers through my limbs
And the wide sleep approaches again
        as a tall man with gentle arms


unconditional
        unanswerable


He strikes a fire while the trembling clouds dance
        and the treetops hide in the mist


I lament and confess to him my fears and guilts
Under the day’s gathering/multivariate greyness
        (with shades) of industrial steel
        and laundered linen
Meeting thundercloud fierceness
        and springtime meekness.


The sky’s brightness burns into darkness
and the fire leaps and traipses
in a thousand symmetrical flowers centered on the man and me
While he sings forgiveness and the
        stars descend and caress, surrounding         
                as wild fireflies standing eternal
in the equinox of my creation.
