There is a measured defee of success
    in reading a vook in an empty livrbary
    w/ the ghosts of the authors as one's company.

Sing me a lullaby my sweet authors
Dance with me as I
    dance in your worlds for
        the time being.

Show me that life isn;t scary, isn;t to
    be fearesm byt to be
        remebered in the writings and photos of the day.

Let us waltz and let us be friends without time to be
    remebered, with tom eto be cherised
May we watch teh sahdows and the candles play
    out constellations of hunan warmth, in an age of
        mosaic beauty and prompt excuses fro song.

"So long as we are warm
    and so long as we are happy
    Never let me go, beacuase without your arm
    entwined in mine,
        I would freeze and I would fall."
