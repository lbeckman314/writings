    Deep in the heart of La Valle Nueve, in the year 1640, on the eve of the winter solstice, La Negra fell--mortally wounded. She carried herself to the base of an oak and leaned against it's strong roots. Around her were twenty-eight Blancos--all of them dead--and all of them wearing the ashen robes of their order. Crimson crosses adorned their chests, made with the dyes of The La'Crocha flower, and sewn with great care. Their faces were turned down, into the dry soil and grass surrounding the large oak.

    A young boy from the small village nearby peered from far away towards the scene. He crouched behind a fallen tree for an hour before approaching. As he walked slowly to the oak tree, he looked at the bodies lying on the earth, white and red. His eyes raised slightly and he stared at the black body slumped against the roots. The boy looked at La Negra and La Negra looked at the boy for many minutes. Breathing showllow, and heavy, La Negra looked away towards the valley below, and the small village visible only by the roof of the church reaching above the trees. Her breathing slowed, untill their was no breath left.

    The boy stood silently, 20 paces away. As soon as La Negra died, he bent down to the ground a picked up a stone and hurrled it at the black body--striking it in the chest and bouncing off away from the oak. He scrambled for another stone and flung it, missing the body. As he hurridely grabbed another, tears fell his eyes and soaked his cheeks. His nose ran and his cheeks blushed as he cried out and cursed La Negra, striking her in the shoulder.

    When the boy's aunt found him, he was curled into himself, wrapped in his own arms and lying on the ground by the body of La Negra. She picked him up slowly, wiping the tears and dirt off his face. She looked around at the Blancos and whispered something small and quiet. She then quickly walked away from the oak, as the light began to fall beyond the western mountains. Never once did she let her eyes fall on the black body nestled in the roots. The boy had exhausted himself, and did not wake from his slumber until he was once again home.
