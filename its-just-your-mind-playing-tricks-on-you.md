```
It's just your mind playing tricks on you
like a mad magician
with a book of spells
written on vellum
written with bone char

It was beneath the blackberries by the garden
    climbing out under rocks with six legs.
It was from ■■■■'s library after ■■■■ passed away
It fell from the sky, each page like a leaf released,
    and assembled itself on the way down.

None of the spells are evil or bad. They're just a
natural consequence of how everything is.
Many do good and wonderful magic,
    and will continue to do so for a long time.
```
