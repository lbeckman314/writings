Oh yes, we had a butler for a good many years â€” Woodsworth was his name. He was a good man by all accounts, although he had a perverse habit of traipsing into the gardens with narry a shred of clothing, carrying a small paddleboard. He would give Mother's petunias and daffodils a gentle spanking with just enough force to, as he put it, "teach them a lesson." Suxual deviancy! That is why kept him.
