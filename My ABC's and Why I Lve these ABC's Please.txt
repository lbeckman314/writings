I'm  tied of being cut by letters
    will you say I choose to?
        to snare and peel and pull
            and destroy my insides?

"Well while you hold it, it's in your power.
    don;t drop it," You warn.

"Enjoy it--these years--because when yoy're 
    my age you don;t hold anything
        except disdain and regret," You warn.

"I'm so tied
    I'm tired of letters and
        cutting myseld", I complain,
            "and not believing anythind
    I have no openions or interests,
        I only want to avoid these sharp letters
            that use me for dirsection and x-rays"

F's the sharpest, looking like a knife
    looking to dice your eyes and slice
        and pray it doesn;t, because (then, now) you're done.
D's seem roundm but the curve
    breaks open your thigh
    and frees the bone from all muscles and grasping
    tendons, handicapping all.
C is just large anought to get caught
    in the throat, drawing more blood then your
    lungs can hold. It will not go away.
        I'm sorry. That's all.
B's are nice, except for the ones that
    burrow deep 'neath the nails, breaking the fingers
    and toes in the process. All of then 
    do this. Pray.
A's play with all, and lead all, and stay
    nowhere cept where their not meant to.
    They are jewels on the crowns of others,
    they are throns for you, and your tounge
    now, so you speak ill of them,
    your teeth so you won;t breathe a word against
    them, your bones, so you stand only with their blesisng.
    WHen they chooses to allow this, let themL
    they lead you to family and happiness. I hope that's true 
    because otherwise I have nothing.

These are the letters you will now, and ohm
how you will knoe, the name of you will be noe
other than the ABC's of you you you, don't
grieve, one breathe your letters and chew your fate,
ecause these are the best years of your life. Pray.


"My ABC's and Why I Lve these ABC's (Please.)"
