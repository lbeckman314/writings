Outside in the frugality of the diamond-bone'd night
    with hallow capillaries providing me a nourishing source
        of chilled turpentine;
Uncovering the sillouett'd body of a silken
    disoreint'd (uni)verse.
One, two start m abd three starts full.
Lynx, draco and perseus
Ecliptic (convulsions, mannerisms) of a topsy-turvy stage
    revolutionizing around, therough, all-wises of our clock.
An operatic war of contralto songs caught in dizzying circles
    I pay the man in the corner ,looking up the blind girl's fress.
and I fo home.

In a bed lightyears too small, covered by hay stalks, the needle in teh phonogram 
    falls and I drift away, wondering "why what not the Suumer SKy in the triangle?" 

3 moths fly in and for ess han a single moment, for less than no time at all
    passes when the record turns, they make my sky complete.
