Have I told you our story boy? How our family came to be _the_ family?

No grandfather, tell me the story.

When I was your your age, my father came to me a nd I knew wgat he was going to say--and I was so _excited_. I had studied as hard as I could everyday, reading and rereading the texts. Every night I would pray to read daste, to learn mire, because even then I knew I would have children of my own one day, and they would have their own chioldren.  I wanted you to know that everything I did, I did for you and Zyra...
She's so young, Zyra, in her own way. How does she enjoy the texts?

She's very good at it--she's even better than I am.

Oh! That's good! That's good... And you work hard, that's all that matters, everything else will come from that. Everything will come together in ways you can't imagine yet. Every cell in your body knows what to do, all you need to do is want it to happen with every ounce of strength you've got.
You know... you're reaching beyond me Cri. I've known it for quite some time, I can't tell you how proud that makes me. I've done all I can, I've done what is right to do. I pray that you will feel this one day.

Thank you, grandfather.


Oh my love
we were younger when we ment
we were younger when you left
far away to distant shores
but I still love you forevermore


Oh my love
I have wasted all my days
on thoughts of you, your loving gaze
Though you be so far
I'll sail the sea, I'll sail la mar



They call it the sea
They call is la mar
