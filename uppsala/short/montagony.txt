Hello there. I don't think we've met before. My name is Max. Let me show you my world.

The most important part is that I'm timeless -- in the sense that I have no time. Things move far too quickly for me to dwell on the, so I just let them fly past me. Scenes intersprersed, with time and space condensed. This is my world.
