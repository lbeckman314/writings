```
    Keep me warm
    and keep me yours
place me next to you in all things ever so slight and ever so small
    because
I need so much
    beginning and enging in our touch
        our exquistite sensibilities and absurd traveks
            our plain features and our endearing sorrows.
    known only as you and I,

    Keep me warm
    and keep me yours.
