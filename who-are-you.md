Who are you?
I am the one man battlefield
        the hunter and hunted
        together at last
                till Dusk we part
                and Dawn we meet.
While the siege I seek
        for the harrowed soldier
comes at last
        in the hallowed smolder
                of a time begotten
        and a people forgotten.
And so all that is left
        all that may be found
is the sole and wearyâ€™d
        beaten
                beaten
                        down.


"Who are you?"
