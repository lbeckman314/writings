A World of Flowers

In the end lie flowers and blood:
Spy the broken bodies
	'neath the gardens of beauty.

Do not go looking for more, young
doe. Look here for all you desire
	'neath the stars that know
					   your name.

Your suffering will mean nothing.
to strange mountains and skies, I
	can see them all burning your
		life from you.

Your home carries your name, will
you let it forget? Lose your name
	in the night that carries you
		to the teeth of monsters.

The Faeries of Evergreen placed great pride in their flowers. On the day of their birth, each faerie-child was bestowed a crown of flowers. Their byrth-crown carried great importance -- it welcomed them into the world, it was the first thing the child could call it's own. Each byrth-crown was made of flowers grown in the home of their grandmothyrs and grandfathyrs. The parents of the child's mothyr would choose live-giving flowers, flowers that nurtured the creatures around it, such as ivy-of-the-bear, mangolyan whispers, and mountain pinelafs. Delicate flowers that grew in the space between things, that wound around and cradled struggling saplings and lent their stryngth so that others might grow. The parents of the child's fathyr would choose life-preserving flowers, flowers that fought against the icy'd byte of the celd, that would sacrifice themselves against the break of the foughnyrer, so that others might survive. They would choose the fahnrer-lily, the faingolding-in-the-night, and tyerohlding-sons. A moon before the child came into the world, each of the two couples would harvest and bring together their offerings. Together, they would craft the byrth-crown into one that fit the child perfectly. For the faerie-children with no lasting mothyr or fathyr, two Evergreen faeries would step forward to welcome the child, bringing them up as their own. In this way, a faerie-child would begin their lives in a world of warmth and love, and not of a world of chyll, and of death.

On the first sunrise of Dycembyr, a young faerie woke to a snowfall that covered the sky with ashen flakes. This faerie's was known as Robwell Lythebrok.


A World of Blood

You should never have returned, young doe.
You are nothing but pain not yet realized;
the world shall open its maw and grind your bones.
You will lie
	broken,
		naked,
			and bare
		   'neath uncaring glaciers (stone) and unseen eyes.
See your fate, young doe, and hope for the end.
End yourself now, young doe,
	and fall into the warmth eternal,
		into a sleep where you cannot be touched,
			where you will remain in bliss undying,
				and relief unending.

The world shall end and bury you.

A World of Monsters (Wolves)

the world will end and you will die in a fire of your own making. And you will see everyone you care about eaten by the fire you created. The fire will be monstrous, because you created it, and monsters beget monsters beget monsters. And you are a monster.

A World of Fire

The world will end in fire
and you will burn.
