Dance around the maypole young doe
    join the flowers & lights & singing
        watch the dresses flutter in blooom
            and the hair swim in the warm summer air.

It is nighttime, young doe
    & and you lie alone on the earth
        like a leaf released and
            ready to sleep under
                snow.

Are you asleep now young doe?
    Do you breathe a different time
        than the more lively and
            alive? Look! They are in
                bloom together!

While you, young foolish doe,
    lie alone in a different time â€”
        after the harvest, after the
            end of all this, read to
                sleep.

So sleep now, sleep now young dow,
    if you do not wish to dance around
        the maypole, then sleep. & so (be)
            ready (yourself) for the snowfalls 
                of winter to bury you
                    while those above (you)
    sleep (in warm homes)
      (in eachothers arms)
        after the dance
        in the summer air.
