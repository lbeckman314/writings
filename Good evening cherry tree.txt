Good evening cherry tree,
how lovely you dance/play in the light of our summer moon.
as/with your wind-touched blossoms enchant/(ing) all
Bringing that O! So lustful shade to the faces
 of your admirers
and how, (may I say,) you transfix their blood with desire
suits you quite well.
For are you not such a lover, in the springtimes of May,
        as in the snowfalls of December.
And yet are you not afraid of losing your color when the cold and night arrive?
        Such would petrify me, as it must surely petrify all who live so long.
But with you, such fear is not elicited. Why, may I ask.
        Why are you so calm on the eve of
the
fall
 of grace?

"Good evening cherry tree"
