"Hi Erin. I'm Erin Plus, but my friends just call me Erin."

"Nice to meet you... Erin," said Erin Minus, previously just Erin.

Erin Plus continued.

"I've heard a lot of great things about you from Karen. She said you're really good with kids."

"I'm alright. They just need someone to talk to every now and then."
