```
Send me by boat
and I'll row to the drumbeat
Send me by boat
and I'll search for pearls with my feet.
Send me by boat,
and if it's captured, I'll pilot under a different flag.
Is the destination a far away coast, an ocean trench?
I'll tighten my belt, hold my breath.
Take the boat, and swim without rest.
```
