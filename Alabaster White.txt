A Monster approaches my home,
    beckoning me to let it in.
    Whispering to let it in.
A Monster approaches my home,
    and i know not what to do.
    and i know not what to do.

It is outside my window now,
    looking in, looking in
    at me what shall i do.
The Monster opens the window
    reaching in, for me, for me
    i have nowhere to go, nowhere to go

It climbs inside, filling the room
    i am alone, i cannot escape
    the monster that is here with me
I shut my eyes and cry i feel it closen
    it feels my face and opens my eyes
    so i must see this monstrosity

See this monstrosity as it breaks my bones
    and loosens my blood so warm
So it spills and drops and flees (flows)
    away from this monstrous form.

"Look at me" it hisses, "look at what you have done"
    "all that you never were
        and all that you could have become!"

i am broken, i am broken but the monster drags me still,
    the monster carries me outside, 
    the window closes, i will never be back inside
The monster releases me, drops me to the earth,
    i do not see where it goes
    i do not see where it goes.

Outside snow falls, covering my body still (when shall i die)? 
    the snow falls, upon my body still (but when shall i die)?

i know not how long i lie, lying for night to fall

I look to my home one last time,
    one last time before i die.

There i am, back at home, warm and safe
    i know not what happens
    i know not what happens
And still i think i will be warm and safe
    for all the time to come
    for all the time to come

How could you not see what happens
    run away you fool!
    you fool! run away

outside i rise, outside i rise,
outside i crouch, bent over and jagged
    i approach
    i approach

"Alabaster White"
