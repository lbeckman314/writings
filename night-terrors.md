```
You told to me to look towards the north
From wence I would find
    my only course

I would not look,I was frightened so
Of the beings that sing
    from the depths below

'Neath the ice and in the black,
    they whisper behind your back
Turn around and you will see,
    naught but the cold staring back at thee

So you must never venture forth
    into these lands,
For they belong to the
     shivering, desolate, sorry man.
```
