When he was a child, my older brother would experience episodic attacks that left him gasping for air. He was almost always alone when they occured, I would learn many years later what exactly these attacks were in clinical terms. 

During one of these experiences, I spied on him through the narrow crack of his bedroom door, as he twitched and twisted away from some invisible force. I remeber how frightened I was â€” too scared to approach him in his violent state, and too scared to leave lest he grow worse and die.
