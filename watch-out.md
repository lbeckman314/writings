```
I'm thinking I can see it
    I've almost got it —

Ah! There! you see?
    There it is —

See how fragile it is?
    Can you see the sunlight through it? —

See how it jumps and jitters and — oh!
    We've lost it again.

    Oh well.

    ...

    You know? —

I'm beginning to think
    it wasn't so special after all.

Maybe you'll find it again,
    maybe you'll enjoy it,

    and that's good.
